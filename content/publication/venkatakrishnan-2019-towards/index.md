abstract: 'The commercialization of Virtual Reality (VR) devices has made it easier for everyday users to experience VR from the comfort of their living rooms. This recent uptake in VR has also increased reported incidents of cybersickness. Cybersickness refers to the discomfort experienced by an individual while experiencing virtual environments. The symptoms are similar to those of motion sickness but are more disorienting in nature resulting in dizziness, blurred vision, etc. Cybersickness is currently one of the biggest hurdles to the widespread adoption of VR, and it is therefore critical to explore the factors that influence its onset. Towards this end, we present a proof of concept simulation to study cybersickness in highly realistic immersive virtual environments.'
