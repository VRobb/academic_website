abstract: 'Social virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a popular online space for teenagers to interact and socialize. It attracts teens due to the broad range of immersive activities and social engagement opportunities, along with diverse users in terms of age and interest. Yet, little is known about teenagers’ experiences and understandings of this emerging online social space, especially regarding what aspects may attract or dissuade them to social VR. To explore this question, we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 teenagers (e.g., ages 13-18) and reported findings regarding what attracted them to engage in social VR and challenges with social VR that may dissuade them from using it. Our findings contribute to the growing body of scholarship on teenagers’ experiences in emerging, novel online social spaces and highlight potential design implications for creating safer and more fulfilling social VR experiences for teenagers.
