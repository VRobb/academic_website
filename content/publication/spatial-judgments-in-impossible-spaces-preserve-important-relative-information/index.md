  In virtual reality (VR), Impossible Spaces allow rooms to overlap

  each other in physical space, enabling developers to better utilize the limited space available for VR systems. Prior work has

  explored detect thresholds for an impossible spaces, but little work

  has considered how impossible spaces affect users’ understandings

  of spatial relationships within virtual environments. We present a

  study evaluating how impossible spaces affected participants’ judgments of a room’s width, and how this was impacted by whether

  participants considered each room individually, or within the context of the entire space. Participants’ judgments of single rooms

  was not impacted by being in an impossible space, however judgments were significantly smaller when considering an impossible

  space as a whole. Even so, participants’ judgments preserved the

  respective ratio between overlapping rooms, indicating that the

  relative sizes of different rooms is preserved in impossible spaces.

  This suggests that while absolute spatial information may be disrupted by impossible spaces, important relative information can be

  preserved. However, it is not yet clear how much of this effect can

  be attributed to lower-level perception and higher-level cognition.
