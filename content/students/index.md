I am currently recruiting students, particularly students with experience developing virtual reality applications in Unity 3D or Unreal, developing conversational agents, or automated machine translation. If youâ€™re interested in understanding how people use virtual reality, and in how virtual reality changes people, please email me and we can set up a meeting. I ask all students interested in working with me to complete a small test project that aligns with our shared research interests to help me gauge your skills and areas of expertise.
