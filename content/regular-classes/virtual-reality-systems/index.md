title: "CPSC 4110/6110 - Virtual Reality Systems (taught in Spring)"
summary: "This is an introductory course discussing the design of virtual reality (VR) hardware and systems. We primarily focus on Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs), though much of the content is also relevant to head-tracked displays, such as a CAVE. This course covers four broad topics: user experiences in VR, optics of HMDs, tracking systems for HMDs, and rending in HMDs. I assume a general technical background and some familiarity with computer graphics or human factors. In the past students from many academic backgrounds (computer science, engineering, architecture, psychology, fine arts) have successfully taken this course. However, some sections (especially the rendering in HMDs section) may be more challenging to students without a background in computer science. If you are unsure if the course is appropriate to your skills you should talk with me prior to enrolling in the class."
