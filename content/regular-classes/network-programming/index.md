title: "CPSC 3600 - Network Programming (taught in Fall)"
summary: "This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of computer networks and network programming. We will cover network programming using sockets, layered network architectures, key application protocols, and how to implement reliable transfer protocols so as to ensure that network traffic arrives at its intended destination without corruption. We will also briefly look at each of the layers of the Internet protocol stack, and (time permitting) discuss some basic network security principles. Students are expected to have prior programming experience, as they will have to complete several individual programming exercises. "
