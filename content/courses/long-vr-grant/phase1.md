Virtual reality games have grown rapidly in popularity since
the first consumer VR head-mounted displays were released
in 2016, however comparatively little research has explored
how this new medium impacts the experience of players. In
this paper, we present a study exploring how user experience
changes when playing Minecraft on the desktop and in immersive virtual reality. Fourteen players completed six 45
minute sessions, three played on the desktop and three in VR.
The Gaming Experience Questionnaire, the i-Group presence
questionnaire, and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire were
administered after each session, and players were interviewed
at the end of the experiment. Participants strongly preferred
playing Minecraft in VR, despite frustrations with using teleporation as a travel technique and feelings of simulator sickness.
Players enjoyed using motion controls, but still continued to
use indirect input under certain circumstances. This did not
appear to negatively impact feelings of presence. We conclude
with four lessons for game developers interested in porting
their games to virtual reality.
