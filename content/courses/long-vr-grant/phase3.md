Little research has explored how people's use of VR changes as they become more experienced with its use. With the advent of consumer VR, users are developing significant experience with VR technology. In this paper, we set out to understand how prior experience with VR might affect a user's sensitivity to rotational gain. We recruited 20 novice VR users (no more than 1 hour or prior experience with any form of HMD) and provided them with an Oculus Quest to use for four weeks on their own time. They were also tasked to complete three activities we designed each week, one of which focused on their sensitivity to rotational gain. No feedback to participants was provided about their performance during each activity, minimizing the possibility of learning effects accounting for any observed changes over time. We observed that participants became significantly more sensitive to rotation gains over time. Additionally, we found that this improvement could be almost entirely attributed to changes between sessions, rather than improvements during the sessions.These results underscore the importance of considering prior user experience in applications involving rotational gain, as well as how prior user experience may affect other, broader applications of VR.

This work explores how users' sensitivity to proprioceptive offsets for virtual hands change as they gain exposure to virtual reality. We conducted one experiment using a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) design over the course of four weeks which was split into four sessions. The trials in each session had a variety of eight offset distances paired with eight offset directions (across a 2D plane). We did not find evidence that users became more sensitive to proprioceptive offsets as they gained experience based on our testing criteria. We did, however, find evidence that related factors such as task completion time with the offsets, head-hand coordination, and object grab times did vary significantly across the trials.
