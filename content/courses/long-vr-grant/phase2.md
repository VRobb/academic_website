Since the release of the Oculus Rift CV1 in 2016, millions of VR headsets have found their way into consumer homes. In this paper, we sought to understand what shifts have taken place within the two years since consumer VR became available. In this paper, we consider what can be learned about long-term use of consumer VR through an analysis of discussions in online forums devoted to VR.
We gathered posts made on the /r/Vive subreddit from the first two years after the HTC Vive's release. We present the results from an in-depth qualitative analysis concerning immersion, presence, and simulator sickness. Over time, as users moved from passive to active, their attitudes and expectations towards immersion and simulator sickness matured. Major trends of interest found were game design implementation and locomotion techniques.

Since the release of the Oculus Rift CV1 in 2016, millions of VR headsets have made their way into consumers' homes. Since then, users have created large quantities of data about their experiences in VR through posts made to online discussion forums. In our first study, we examine this data to gain insights on what sorts of ``lingering effects'' users report having experienced after VR, and on the progression of these effects over time. 
%After identifying search terms designed to elicit comments made about lingering effects, we searched through two years of posts made to /r/Vive, a forum focused on the HTC Vive. 
We found three major categories of lingering effects (besides simulator sickness) during our qualitative analysis: perceptual effects, behavioral effects, and changes in dreams. The perceptual and behavioral categories were further divided into sub-themes: disruption of body ownership and proprioception, loss of a sense of depth in the real world, visual aftereffects, the need to verify the reality of the real world through touch, hesitation when moving in the real world, and attempts to apply VR interaction metaphors to real life interactions. Users were nearly unanimous that these lingering effects only occurred after spending at least one hour in VR, and that these effects completely disappeared several weeks after they first appeared (assuming the user continued to spend time in VR). There was less agreement about how long these effects lasted after exiting a specific VR session. The results of our analysis suggest that users feel that there are no long-term side effects to the use of VR. We then report the results of a second study following twenty novice users over the course of their first four weeks using VR. Semi-structured interviews with participants further substantiated the findings of our first study.
