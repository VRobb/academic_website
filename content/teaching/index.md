# Regularly Taught Courses

### CPSC 4110/6110 - Virtual Reality Systems (taught every Fall)

This is an introductory course to the theory, technology, software, design, application, and human factor issues in virtual reality. This course primarily focuses on the creation of virtual environments using either a head-mounted display or a head-tracked display. The course assumes a general technical background and some type of experience with computer graphics, user interface design, or computer vision. In the past students from many academic backgrounds (computer science, engineering, architecture, psychology, fine arts) have successfully taken this course. This course is heavily project oriented. All students will work with a small group of students to create their own virtual environment. The project topic can be of your choosing. If you are unsure if the course is appropriate to your skills you should talk with the instructor.

### CPSC 3600 - Network Programming (taught every Spring)

I teach a network programming class

### Creative Inquiry Classes

.... run a creative inquiry class ... ideally students participate for the entire year

# Sporadically Offered Courses

### CPSC 8810 -- Embodied Conversational Agents and Virtual Avatars (last taught Fall 2017)

This course explores social interactions in virtual reality, specifically with embodied conversational agents (ECAs) and with virtual avatars. ECAs are computer programs that have a visual representation and support some forms of natural social interaction. Virtual avatars are similar, except that they are digital representations of other humans. With regard to ECAs, we will discuss a range of topics including social presence, the role of behavioral and visual fidelity on perceived realism, design guidelines, relational agents, teachable agents, and training applications. With regard to avatars, we will discuss self presence, the body ownership illusion, and how characteristics of your avatar can unconsciously impact your behavior.

This course is strongly research oriented. We will not be developing ECAs or avatars in this course. Instead, we will focus on understanding and synthesizing existing research literature in order to understand how to design ECAs and avatars so as to achieve specific objectives. Assignments will include finding and presenting research papers relevant to the class, proposing novel research questions pertaining to ECAs and virtual avatars, designing a research experiment to address a proposed question, and a group assignment to prepare a survey paper concerning a specific aspect of ECAs or virtual avatars (e.g. persuasion effects of virtual agents, or effective virtual avatar design for social change).

### CPSC 4820/6820 - Designing Games for Virtual Reality (last taught Fall 2016)

In this course students will learn the fundamentals of designing virtual reality games. We will discuss foundational game design principles and examine how these principles specifically apply to virtual reality. Special focus will be given to novel interaction techniques, cultivating feelings of presence, avoiding simulator sickness, and promoting pro-social behaviors. Over the course of the semester, students will work in small groups to complete several projects, culminating in the development of a complete virtual reality game using Unity 3D and the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift.
